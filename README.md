# Dam Removals with Peer-Reviewed Studies Database

Dam Removals are becoming an increasingly proven tool to restore river health, improve public safety, revitalize fish and wildlife populations, safeguard cultural values and reconnect communities to their rivers.

American Rivers posts a "State of Dam Removal in the US" report that highlights removals in the past year, as well as future removal projects. The current goal of this webmap is to provide a better visual with links to physical, biological, and water quality peer-reviewd articles and reports to better understand ecological responses and why and how this removals benefit river health and communities.

The future goal of this web map is to provide a tool for engineers, policymakers, and scientific researchers to compare removals across the country to guide their work in potential future removal projects by mapping and including variables that influence a river's recovery trajectory.
